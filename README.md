## Dependencies

All dependencies can be installed using the following,

``` r
remotes::install_dev_deps()
```

If `cmdstanr` has not been installed previously then stan may need to be
installed. This can be done using the following,

``` r
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

Alternatively a docker
[container](https://github.com/epiforecasts/eval-omicron-for-case-forecasting/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile)
and
[image](https://github.com/epiforecasts/eval-omicron-for-case-forecasting/pkgs/container/eval-omicron-for-case-forecasting)
is provided. An easy way to make use of this is using the Remote
development extension of `vscode`.

## Analyses

This analysis in this repository has been implemented using the
[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package and associated
packages. The workflow is defined in
[`_targets.md`](https://github.com/epiforecasts/eval-omicron-for-case-forecasting/blob/main/_targets.md)
and can be explored interactively using
[`_targets.Rmd`](https://github.com/epiforecasts/eval-omicron-for-case-forecasting/blob/main/_targets.Rmd)
`Rmarkdown` document. The workflow can be visualised as the following
graph.

This complete analysis can be recreated using the following (note this
may take quite some time even with a fairly large amount of available
compute),

``` bash
bash bin/update-targets.sh
```

Alternative the following `targets` functions may be used to
interactively explore the workflow:

-   Run the workflow sequentially.

``` r
targets::tar_make()
```

-   Run the workflow using all available workers.

``` r
targets::tar_make_future(workers = future::availableCores())
```

-   Explore a graph of the workflow.

``` r
targets::tar_visnetwork(targets_only = TRUE)
```

Watch the workflow as it runs in a `shiny` app.

``` r
targets::tar_watch(targets_only = TRUE)
```

To use our archived version of the interim results (and so avoid long
run times) use the following to download it. Note that this process has
not been rigorously tested across environments and so may not work
seamlessly).

``` r
source(here::here("R", "targets-archive.R"))
get_targets_archive()
```
